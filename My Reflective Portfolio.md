# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 11
### What have I learnt this week?
This week we didn’t learn anything new, but me and my team got feedback from our lecturer, Juan about our Pre-submission 3 weeks prior. Most of the feedback was positive, and I found that it does very much echo the peer review feedback we got. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week’s learning’s taught me a lot heeding the feedback I get from teachers.

### What insights have I gained?
The insights I gained from this week’s are that while reading and following Juan's feedback helped our group to realise where exactly we fell short in our pre-submission assessment, and paved the way forward for what improvements we are going to make. So it is time to get to work.  

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Perceived strengths:
-	Took lecturer’s feedback into account, and commenced work on the many-model thinking assessment
-	Focus on modelling our models in a way that makes a direct point, thereby enabling us to understand the complexities of political election systems in the US

Perceived weaknesses:
-Still have issues comprehending Python on Jupyter-coding can be frustrating, in this arena, patience truly is a virtue that I do not possess here
-	Really in getting down to brass tacks in what I have to do for my assigned part, which is section 5

### What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges I and my team observed this week are that we needed to fully understand Juan’s feedback to us. I have been assigned section 5, which is to establish baseline parameter sets and or configuration for output scenarios, and perform a basic sensitivity analysis, i.e., identify with parameters are most sensitive/insensitive for the outputs. Luckily for us,  Juan provided our team with sufficient enough resources, to further improve our  group report. Additionally, the due date of this assessment was changed to November 6th-which I found funnily ironic as it is a few days after the results would be announced as to who will win the US Presidency, and which we’re all grateful for this extension, so our group code can be improved upon as well and work.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to draft my section, and really look at the parameters and configurations related to this year’s US election, so I can better analyse the situation.  Emphasis needs to be put to help improve coding for the network model, and me and my team discussed ways in which it can be simplified, but directly gets to the point about how the US states vote, the blue symbolises Democrat, and red, Republican. By doing all of this collaboration together, we stand a better chance of getting higher results. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
There were no new theories this week.
